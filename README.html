<h1>Sassify Textpattern!</h1>

<p>This plugin allows the use of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> for CSS preprocessing
within textpattern.</p>

<p>It will compile the SASS code you define within the regular CSS style form to
static CSS files, serving it through a tag which is quite similar to the well
known &lt;txp:css /&gt; tag.</p>

<p>This plugin relies on <a href="http://phpsass.com/">phpSASS</a> and borrows code from the
<a href="https://drupal.org/project/sassy">sassy</a> module for Drupal.</p>

<p>It started off as a hack of <a href="http://textpattern.org/plugins/934/rvm_css">rvm_css</a>,
which can do similar things with LESS. Under the hood you will find that it is still
heavily based on the code of the great <a href="http://vanmelick.com/">Ruud van Melick</a>.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ol>
<li>Grab a copy of <a href="http://phpsass.com/">PHPSass</a> and put it somewhere your
webserver can find it. The default location is &#8216;textpattern/vendor/phpsass&#8217;.</li>
<li>Create a directory for the static CSS files on your webserver. You should make
sure that PHP is able to write to that directory. The default path to this
directory is /css.</li>
<li>Install and enable the plugin like any other plugin out there.</li>
<li>Check and adjust the configuration under the extensions tab. It ships with
sane default. See section &#8220;Configuration&#8221; for details.</li>
<li>If you want to play safe: Resave a CSS style definition form and see if there
is a file written to the output directory you have configured in step 2. You&#8217;ll
need to resave all your style sheets anyway to create the static files.</li>
<li>Once your set you may replace all occurrences of &lt;txp:css /&gt; with
&lt;txp:goe_sass /&gt;.</li>
</ol>

<p>The &lt;txp:goe_sass /&gt; tag supplied by this plugin has the exact same
attributes as the built-in &lt;txp:css /&gt; tag and can be used as a drop-in
replacement.</p>

<p>Note: Because not all characters are allowed in filenames, avoid using
non-alphanumeric characters in style sheet names.</p>
